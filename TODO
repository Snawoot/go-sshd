* Make sure to not run this as root (setuid doesn't work well), so use NET capabilities
* Allow limiting the hosts that one can connect to use direct-tcpip (right now
  all hosts are allowed)
* Allow lifting restrictions on what clients can bind on with forwarded-tcpip

* Check assertions and TODOs.
* Look if/where we want to set deadlines on open sockets
* Go through all log.Println calls, and make sure they are unique(?) and
  sensible, and are not too verbose, and/or hidden behind *verbose
